## Description

The purpose of this project was to get experience using progressive web applications. Whilst I was able to get the build to run on a local host, it seems to only let me do it once until giving a `npm WARN config production Use `--omit=dev` instead` error on the command line. None the less, I did my best to add the necessary code to get this build to work properly. This is a project that will be looked at again in the future in order to better understand the concepts. 

## Installation

- Make sure to have all the necessary packages installed when running this build from the command line!

## Credits

Thank you to the University of Arizona for providing me the tools and resources to gain experience in this part of web development. I am excited to take what I have learned with me as I progress through my coding journey!
